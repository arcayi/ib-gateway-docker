```

You will now have the IB Gateway app running on port 4003 and VNC on 5901.

See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for configuring VNC password, accounts and trading mode.

Please do not open your box to the internet.

### Testing VNC

* localhost:5901

![vnc](docs/ib_gateway_vnc.jpg)

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, when running in non-daemon mode, you will see this:

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.awt.AWTError: Can't connect to X11 window server using ':0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable.
```

You will have to remove the container `docker rm container_id` and run `docker-compose up` again.
